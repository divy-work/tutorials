# C++

This is the C++ Tutorial Repository for ProLang Tutorials. If you wish to teach a new library that hasn't been covered in the tutorial already, in the Libraries folder, please make a new folder with the name of the library. Example: `<cctype>`

To use, either download, or copy paste into your editor. Access the .cpp file for that lesson, put what you want to run INSIDE `main()`, go to your terminal, find the directory you are currently in, and compile.

### Useful terminal commands:

```bash
$ ls -lt
```

* This shows the contents of the current directory you are in. ls is the command for listing files and directories where you currenly are, -l formats it a tad, and -t lists by last edited. The file at the top should be your main.cpp file, if it isn't you are in the wrong directory

```bash
$ cd (directoryName)
```

or

```bash
$ cd ..
```

* This goes back one directory. cd is the Change Directory command. .. after it takes you back one directory. The name of a directory in the one you are in currently can be put in after cd to take you to that directory.

```bash
$ g++ (fileName).cpp
```

* If you are running Windows or Mac, this will compile your code, and make a file in the directory you are currently in. This file is called a.out.

```bash
$ ./a.out
```

* This will run the computer-generated code you just compiled, and will run your code!
