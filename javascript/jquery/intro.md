# jQuery Intro

## About
jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. In other words, jQuery was designed to make using JavaScript easier and faster for web developers. It is a free, open-source software using the MIT License and as of 2019, jQuery is used by 73% of the 10 million most popular websites.

jQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications using a common symbol, the us dollar "$". jQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the JavaScript library. This enables developers to create abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets. The modular approach to the jQuery library allows the creation of powerful dynamic web pages and Web applications.
